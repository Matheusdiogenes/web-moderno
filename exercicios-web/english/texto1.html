            When I was a kid,
            the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.
            That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement,
            filled with cans of food and water.
            When the nuclear attack came,
            we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.
            Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe
            doesn't look like this.
            Instead, it looks like this.
            If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,
            it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus
            rather than a war.<br/>
            Not missiles, but microbes.
            Now, part of the reason for this is that
            we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.
            But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.
            We're not ready for the next epidemic.
            Let's look at Ebola.
            I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper,
            lots of tough challenges.
            I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools
            we use to track polio eradication.
            And as you look at what went on,
            the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough,
            the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.
            In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.
            We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone,
            seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.
            The case reports came in on paper.
